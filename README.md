This is the contribution to the UniBe Reproducibility Hackathon by Inken Fender and Jannik Gut.

We managed to finish study 34 and touched on study 01.

The files are in their respective folders. The report.ipynb is the main deliverable with other files needed to fully reproduce, like data and the environment.
